import cv2
import numpy 


cap = cv2.VideoCapture('/home/luqman/Desktop/output.avi')

while(cap.isOpened()):
        ##### Segmentation
    ## Defining the color Upper bound and Lower bound limits to extract 
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    light_line = numpy.array([ 100,100,100])
    dark_line = numpy.array([200,200,200])
    mask = cv2.inRange(frame, light_line,dark_line)

        ##### Boundaries Extraction
    ## applying the canny edge dector function
    canny= cv2.Canny(mask,40,10)
    ## Cropping the image
    r1=150;c1=0
    img = canny[r1:r1+240,c1:c1+640]
    ##### Finding Line  Mid point
    ## Visually finding the perfect Row to fix for mid points
    ## by setting all values to be light
    edge=[]
    for i in range (639):
        if(img[160,i]==255):
            edge.append(i)
    print(edge)

    ## We only need two points # one from left line # second from right line 
    # When values are 4
    if(len(edge)==4):
        edge[0]=edge[0]
        edge[1]=edge[2]
    ## When Values are 3 and if they are 2 we donot need to process them
    ## If the values of pixels is greater then 5 then they are adjecent to eachother
    if(len(edge)==3):
        for i in range(len(edge)):
            if(edge[1]-edge[0] > 5): ## meaning idx(0) and idx(1) are ok [193, 506, 507 ]
                edge[0]=edge[0]
                edge[1]=edge[1]
            else:#[193, 194, 507 ]
                edge[0]=edge[0]
                edge[1]=edge[2]
    ## Apllying a white pixel to final line mid point found
    mid_area=(edge[1]-edge[0])
    mid_point= +edge[0] + (mid_area/2)
    img[160,int(mid_point)]=255



        ##### Finding Frame Mid point
    frame_mid = 639/2


        ##### Controlling the car process
    ## Although it is not applying velocites yet but we will print things on the
    # Screen to see the output
    error=frame_mid-mid_point 

    if(error < 0):## go left
        action="Go Right"
    else :
        action="Go Left"



    ## More apparent mid frame pixel by setting upper and lower pixels to be white 
    img[160,int(frame_mid)]=255
    img[159,int(frame_mid)]=255
    img[161,int(frame_mid)]=255
    ## Writing on the Frame as output for better understanding
    f_image = cv2.putText(img, action, (50,50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (255,0,), 2, cv2.LINE_AA)



    print("Error",error,"  /  Frame_mid",frame_mid,"  /  Mid_point",mid_point)
    
    cv2.imshow('output image',f_image)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
